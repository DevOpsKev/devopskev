## Open Source Advocate, DevOps Coach, DevOps Engineer, Blogger, Podcaster, Author, Founder

### ðŸ’¬  "What is a DevOps Coach?"

> "An Agile Coach will console you about your problems. A DevOps Coach will use a console to help you solve them. We're more hands on."

### ðŸ’¬  "Why do you do it?"

>"No matter their goal. I coach people in the ability to learn faster and change faster. People may be individuals, teams or entire organizations. My clients operate within the digital economy and are involved in the development of technology-enabled products. 
>
>I have a diverse set of skills and experience. This characteristic is essential for success at what I do. That is coach and mentor teams which consist of talented professionals representing a broad range of specialisms.
>
>My own specialism is coaching people in how to translate DevOps principles into practice.
>
>Every day I work I am financially rewarded for learning new things and helping others do the same.
>
>I am a DevOps Coach; it is a vocation, not a job.
>
>I do it, because I love it."

### ðŸ’¬  "What's your special sauce?"
>I've worn many hats throughout my career, including senior technical leadership roles, management consultant, agile coach, and all-out hardcore engineer.
>
>This experience allows me to operate at any level, bridging the communication gap from code-commit to CEO.
>
>That said, I've always been at my happiest elbow-deep in a code base.

## Career Highlights

### [CERN](https://home.cern/)
I recently had the privilege of working with CERN on an architectural design for control systems for the large hardon collider. I played a modest role in the project, focusing on Kubernetes architectures and reviewing CICD implementations. It was just amazing to be a part of the CERN project. Smart people, as you would expect, it felt good to have to raise my bar to meet the challenge.

### [Lunar Zebro](https://zebro.space/)
Working with the Alten Group, I had the opportunity to get involved with a moon lander project at TU Delft. How could I say no? I spent over two years working with the team as a DevOps Coach, mentor, and hands-on DevOps engineer. The team was a young group of amazingly talented individuals. The future is in good hands.

### [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/)
Although it goes back a bit, working with the FT remains one of my favorite engagements. We did great work on .com, paving the way to a sale of FT.com to the Nikkei index for 1.3 billion dollars. It was fantastic working with journalists and techies alike. It was a special time, and I made some friends for life.

My enthusiasm stems from the opportunity to share insights, lessons learned, and foster the adoption of DevOps best practices within the development community.
