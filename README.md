## Open Source Advocate, DevOps Coach, DevOps Engineer, Blogger, Podcaster, Author, Founder

### ðŸ’¬  "Describe a DevOps Coach?"

> "An Agile Coach will console you about your problems. A DevOps Coach will use a console to help you solve them. I'm the more hands on type."

### ðŸ’¬  "Why do you do it?"

>"No matter their goal. I coach people in the ability to learn faster and change faster. People may be individuals, teams or entire organizations. My clients operate within the digital economy and are involved in the development of technology-enabled products. 
>
>I have a diverse set of skills and experience. This characteristic is essential for success at what I do. That is coach and mentor teams which consist of talented professionals representing a broad range of specialisms.
>
>My own specialism is coaching people in how to translate DevOps principles into practice.
>
>Every day I work I am financially rewarded for learning new things and helping others do the same.
>
>I am a DevOps Coach; it is a vocation, not a job.
>
>I do it, because I love it."

### ðŸ’¬  "What's your special source?"
>I've worn many hats throughout my career, including senior technical leadership roles, management consult, agile coach, and all-out hardcore engineer.
>
>This experience allows me to operate at any level, bridging the communication gap from code-commit to CEO.
>
>That said, I've always been at my happiest elbow-deep in a code base.
